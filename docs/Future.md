# Future
This file describes all planned features to be added in the future

- Algorithms
    - Melodic algorithms
        - (Gaussian) Voicing
        - Markov Chains
        - ...
    - Rhythmic algorithms
        - 1/f Noise
        - Most Common Structures (MCS)
        - Markov Chains
        - ...
    - Chord Note Count algorithms
        - Markov Chains
        - ...
    - _(Dynamic algorithms)_
    - _(Custom algorithm parsing)_
- MidiPlayer
    - _(Force playing at all times)_
- Styles
    - Add styles:
        - `Boogie`: `C-C-F-C-G-F-C`
        - `Pop`: `E-B-C#-A`
- Config
    - Make it so the execution does not break on invalid input (preprocessing)
    - Allow `autoplayer` to be executed anywhere.
    - _(Ability to randomize anything)_
- General Todo
    - Simple Installation
    - Markov Chain Preparation
        - conversion from `MIDI`-files to `MusicXML`-files can be done on linux if `MuseScore 2` is installed via `musescore -o output.xml input.mid`
        - Add `MusicXML` note parser for pitch and rhythm.
        - Add Markov Chain file extension (csv?)
        - Do some machine learning (add commandline arguments for this, so it can be done on studento? New executable?)
        - Interpret Markov Chain files
