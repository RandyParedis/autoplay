This file describes all planned features to be added in the future

- Algorithms
    - Melodic algorithms
        - Accompaniment
        - Centralized
        - (Gaussian) Voicing
        - Markov Chains
        - ...
    - Rhythmic algorithms
        - 1/f Noise
        - Markov Chains
        - Most Common Structures (MCS)
        - ...
    - _(Dynamic algorithms)_
    - _(Custom algorithm parsing)_
- MidiPlayer
    - Optimize playback (redo algorithm).
    - _(Force playing at all times)_
- Config
    - Make it so the execution does not break on invalid input (preprocessing)
    - Add `instruments.json` and `styles.json` to the config file (and parsing of arguments with flags (`-i`, `--instruments`) or (`-s`, `--styles`))
    - _(Ability to randomize anything)_
- General Todo
    - Simple Installation
    - Automatic beaming for notes
