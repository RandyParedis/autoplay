Class Structure - autoplay
--------------------------

class Note:
	- byte pitch <0-126>
	- byte volume (velocity)
	- byte duration
	- byte timing
	- bit pause
	
map<string, Note*> Notes; /// bv:  Notes["A4"] = Note(pitch=69)
	
class Sequence:
	- unsigned int bpm
	- unsigned int ppq
	- drum_channel=10
	- change_bpm(new_bpm)
	- stream(Note n, channel c):
		for all known channels d <= c ordered incremently
			send stop of last note on channel d
		end
		clear all known channels
		add a known channel c
		send start of n in channel c
